# The Family Table
The Family Table is a responsive, full MERN stack web application for users to store their favorite recipes and share them with their loved ones. Users are able to create tables, allowing any who are a part of them to see any recipe of the table members. Protected with JWT tokens, only you and your family / families will have access to your personal recipes. (Heroku takes a bit to spin up so give the site a sec to load as well as signup/login) You can find the application [here](http://the-family-table.herokuapp.com/).
